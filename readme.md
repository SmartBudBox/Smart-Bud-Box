# Smart-Bud-Box
A small full automatic DIY Growbox with Web Interface for everyone.

# Install
Read the Manuals at /instrcutions/ for build the box and set up the Interface. We also got a little Growbook for the first steps


## Todo
- complete the "Planer" to make plans like watering if soil under 360
- languages files for multilang
- write a growbook and put it to interface
- put the instrcutions for building and install to project as .pdf
- Addons like: libra, temp/humi for othside

## Wanna help?
You can help me by translate the language files (comming soon) into your langauge or make a new web design =)
